# Pandas-Challenge

Reading through the Heroes of Pymoli assignment, noted down in a notepad of the steps to be done.
Following the instructions, and created a new github repo for pandas assignment and named it pandas-challenge.
Cloned the repo to my computer, so I can do regular commits from the folder into github, then created a folder for the assignment.
Did a commit to github, so the csv and panda file is stored into the github as a start.

#CODE overview

For the first step to count total number of players, by reviewing classes from lessons from days before I found out that easiest way for me to figure out how to was to use ".unique" code but in this case I was getting all the strings in columns not the numbers, than I have done some additional researching and got the code ".nunique"  to get clear number.After that to sort out Purchase Analysis I have done with just basic calculations like sum, mean and again .nunique, than done a format with float_format to get the displayed data cleaner formatting. Similar calculations as above, followed for age demographics and the purchasing analysis based on the age demographics.For top spenders, the calculations and creating dataframes were the same as above, while the final dataframe was also sorted in descending order based on the total purchase value.Most popular items and most profitable items followed the same trend of calculations as above - the most popular items is sorted based on the purchase count, while the most profitable items was sorted based on the total purchase value.

#Conclusion

For this homework I've spent 15-20hours outside of the class to get everything sorted. As Final result we have:

Majority of players are male 84% who are generating \$1,967
Female players are on average more likely to purchase more expensive items and bring more value per purchase.
About 44% of the players are in age group between 20 - 24
With 179 unique items, there was 780 purchases that generated \$2,379
